Chess in text format.

How to play:

Move a piece by entering its position followed by a space and its desired destination.

Example
INPUT: a2 a3

This will move a piece on a2 to a3, given that it is a legal move by that piece.
If not, you will be notified of an illegal move and will have to re-enter your input.

Enter "resign" to quit.
