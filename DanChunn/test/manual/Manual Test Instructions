The best way to test our application is through play test (specifically for component tests).

Move Piece Test:
    1. Start a game (run code)
    2. Select Start Game
    3. Make move a2 a4
    4. Observe that pW at a2 moves to a4 (viewable from printing board)
    5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for any pieces you wish to see move and use board print to see movement.

Save/Load Game Test:
