The best way to test our application is through play test (specifically for component tests).

Move Piece Test:
    1. Start a game (run Chess run configuration)
    2. Select Start Game
    3. Make move a2 a4
    4. Observe that pW at a2 moves to a4 (viewable from printing board)
    5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 for any pieces you wish to see move and use board print to see movement.
    6. Test invalid move (Should be told it is invalid)

Save/Load Game Test:
    1. Start a game (run Chess run configuration)
    2. Select Start Game
    3. Make multiple moves
    4. Take a picture of the game board
    5. Quit game (using quit command, this saves the game automatically)
    6. Start game again (run Chess run config)
    7. Select Resume game
    8. Check that the the picture and the loaded game are the same game board, if so Test is confirmed

Voice Recognition Test:
    1. Run the Speech Recognition Test run configuration
    2. Wait 2 Seconds
    3. Say anything
    4. Make sure returned print results are the same as what you said

Other General Game Rules:
    You can play through the game to confirm all other test rules occur properly.
    For example, if a pawn reaches the other side it turns into a queen,
    Check and Checkmate are properly determined (as well as making you get out of check when in check),
    Taking other players pieces.
